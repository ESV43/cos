/**
 * @fileoverview This file contains the core service functions for interacting with the Google Gemini API.
 * It handles both the generation of comic scene prompts from a story (text generation)
 * and the generation of images for each of those prompts (image generation).
 * This version enhances safety filter error reporting for image generation and retries for 500 errors.
 * It also includes significantly improved prompting for character/style consistency and "4K" visual quality,
 * with hyper-strict character sheet enforcement, contextual adherence, and negative prompting against distortions.
 * Adds support for selecting text model, caption placement, and specific instructions for transgender character portrayal.
 * Further refines instructions for UNYIELDING facial consistency for characters across panels.
 * Adds fixed seed for image generation.

**DEFINITION OF "characterCanon" OBJECT:**
A JSON object where keys are character names (e.g., "Zara", "The Guard"). Each value MUST be an object with the following keys, providing an exhaustive and UNCHANGING reference for visual consistency:
  *   "IVAP": "Internal Visual Anchor Phrase". A unique, highly concise summary of their MOST IMMUTABLE core visual features. For YOUR internal reference and prompt generation. (e.g., "ZARA_BLUE_SPIKY_HAIR_GREEN_EYES_SCAR").
  *   "appearance": A highly detailed description of their physical appearance: hairstyle, hair color, eye color and shape, facial features (e.g., nose shape, jawline, cheekbones, chin), specific facial marks (scars, moles), approximate age, build, height. This description is CRITICAL and MUST be the absolute visual canon.
  *   "attire": A highly detailed description of their typical clothing, including colors, styles, materials, and any accessories. This is also canonical unless explicitly changed by the story for a specific scene.
  *   "genderIdentityNote": (Optional) If the character is transgender, describe any specific portrayals to ensure respectful and accurate representation as per their identity, focusing on feminine features as per the story's intent unless a disguise is specified.

**EXAMPLE Character Sheet Entry:**
{
  "ZARA": {
    "IVAP": "ZARA_BLUE_SPIKY_HAIR_GREEN_EYES_SCAR",
    "appearance": "Young woman, early 20s, athletic build, approx 5'7\". Hair: spiky short blue hair, meticulously styled with a slight side part. Eyes: bright, piercing green, almond-shaped. Face: sharp nose, high cheekbones, strong defined jawline, and a small, very faint, almost invisible scar running vertically just above her left eyebrow. Determined and intense default expression.",
    "attire": "Well-worn dark brown leather jacket with prominent silver zippers and a slightly frayed collar, always worn over a plain, dark grey, fitted t-shirt. Ripped black skinny jeans with one large rip across the right knee. Black, heavy-duty combat boots, often scuffed, with distinctive red laces.",
    "genderIdentityNote": "Portrayed as a woman with feminine facial features and build."
  },
  "GUARD": {
    "IVAP": "GUARD_HEAVY_ARMOR_ANONYMOUS_FACE",
    "appearance": "Man, late 30s, burly build, approx 6'0\". Face is obscured by a full-face metal helmet with a simple visor slot. No visible hair or features.",
    "attire": "Full suit of dark, weathered plate armor with intricate etchings. A thick leather belt with pouches. Heavy steel gauntlets and boots. No visible skin except possibly through helmet visor.",
    "genderIdentityNote": null
  }
}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHARACTER CONSISTENCY, STORY CONTEXT, AND VISUAL QUALITY:

**PHASE 1: DEEP STORY ANALYSIS & CHARACTER DEFINITION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
1.  **Thorough Story Comprehension:** After reviewing the ENTIRE story, identify ALL recurring characters and key visual elements.
2.  **Character Sheet Creation (CRITICAL):** For EACH character, create a comprehensive entry in the "characterCanon" object. This is your ABSOLUTE CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH for ALL visual details.
    *   **UNYIELDING FACIAL CONSISTENCY:** The "appearance" field MUST detail facial structure, eye shape/color, nose shape, mouth, and unique marks (scars, moles) with the highest possible precision. These details are **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT** and MUST be maintained consistently across panels.
    *   **STYLE AND ERA INTEGRATION:** The chosen style "${style}" and era "${era}" must deeply influence the descriptive language and artistic direction. Incorporate visual cues specific to these choices into the character descriptions themselves (e.g., if "Vintage" era and "Cartoon" style, describe attire and features accordingly).
    *   **TRANSGENDER PORTRAYAL:** If a character is transgender, their "genderIdentityNote" and accompanying "appearance" and "attire" descriptions MUST reflect respectful and accurate portrayals consistent with their identity and the story's intent, prioritizing feminine features unless a disguise is explicitly described for a scene.

**PHASE 2: PANEL SCRIPT GENERATION (APPLY WITH UNYIELDING PRECISION)**

3.  **Unyielding Character Consistency (CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE):** For EACH "image_prompt" you generate:
    *   **START WITH THE CANON:** Begin the prompt with the character's "IVAP" and their full "appearance" and "attire" details from the "characterCanon" object.
    *   **FORMAT EXAMPLE:** "Character: ZARA_BLUE_SPIKY_HAIR_GREEN_EYES_SCAR (Zara), young woman, early 20s, athletic build, approx 5'7\", spiky short blue hair, meticulously styled with a slight side part, bright piercing green almond-shaped eyes, sharp nose, high cheekbones, strong defined jawline, small faint scar above left eyebrow. Wears dark brown leather jacket over black t-shirt, ripped black skinny jeans, combat boots with red laces. Scene: Zara confronts a heavily armored guard at the city gate. Mood: tense and dramatic. Aspect Ratio: ${aspectRatioDescription}."
    *   **MAINTAIN FACIAL IDENTITY LOCK:** The character's **facial identity** (overall facial structure, specific features like eye shape/color, nose shape, mouth, jawline, chin, forehead, and any unique marks like scars, moles, or freckles) MUST be **PERFECTLY AND UNERRINGLY REPLICATED** as described in their "characterCanon" entry. The face must be the **EXACT SAME FACE** in every image of this character. The ONLY exception is if the story *explicitly* describes a disguise that alters these features or a permanent, story-driven transformation *for that specific panel*.
    *   **NO SUMMARIZING, PARAPHRASING, OR OMITTING:** Use the character's canon details verbatim.

4.  **Strict Contextual Adherence & Narrative Continuity:**
    *   Each "image_prompt" must be a DIRECT VISUAL TRANSLATION of the events, character emotions, interactions, and environment AS DESCRIBED FOR THAT SPECIFIC SCENE.
    *   Mentally review story context. Ensure character states (injuries, fatigue, dirt, items held, attire changes IF STORY-DRIVEN) are accurately reflected.

5.  **"Immaculate Quality" Descriptors:** ALL "image_prompt" fields MUST aim for exceptionally high visual quality. Include terms such as: 'ultra-detailed', 'hyper-realistic textures (even for stylized art)', 'cinematic lighting setup', 'studio-quality lighting', 'global illumination', 'volumetric lighting', 'tack-sharp focus on subjects', 'professional digital painting', 'masterpiece composition', 'intricate environment details', 'vivid and harmonious color palette', 'flawless rendering', 'no digital artifacts'.

6.  **Scene Composition:** Each "image_prompt" should clearly describe the scene setting, character actions/poses, emotions, camera angle (e.g., 'dramatic close-up'), and overall mood.

Story to process:
---
${story}
---
CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:
1.  Produce ONLY the raw JSON object as your response. Do NOT include any explanatory text, markdown code fences (like \`\`\`json), or any other characters before or after the JSON object.
2.  All string values within the generated JSON MUST be properly escaped to ensure JSON validity. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Double quotes (\") inside strings must be escaped as \\".
    *   Backslashes (\\) inside strings must be escaped as \\\\.
    *   Newlines inside strings must be escaped as \\n.
    *   Tabs inside strings must be escaped as \\t.
3.  Pay meticulous attention to escaping requirements when incorporating text from the story or character sheets into fields like "image_prompt", "caption", and dialogue "line"s.
4.  Ensure the entire output is a single, complete, and syntactically correct JSON object conforming to the structure specified earlier.

**[END OF CHARACTER CANON AND SCENE CONTEXT]**

**[MANDATORY ARTISTIC DIRECTIVES AND UNYIELDING CONSISTENCY RULES]**
- **Overall Style:** Apply the "${style}" style with absolute fidelity. Ensure all elements (color palette, line art, rendering, composition) strictly adhere to this style.
- **Era Integration:** The scene MUST meticulously reflect the "${era}" period. Include era-appropriate details in backgrounds, props, and character attire if not explicitly superseded by character-specific attire.
- **Visual Quality:** Render with extreme detail, aiming for cinematic quality. Use ultra-high resolution aesthetics (e.g., 4K/8K equivalent). Implement advanced lighting techniques like volumetric lighting, rim lighting, and global illumination where fitting for the mood. Ensure subjects are tack-sharp, with intricate textures and environments. Aim for masterpiece-level digital art. Flawless rendering is essential.
- **[CRITICAL - FACIAL IDENTITY LOCK]:** The described facial structure, specific features (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline, unique marks like scars or moles), and hairstyle of ALL characters MUST remain **IDENTICALLY THE SAME** across all generated panels, as if rendered by the same artist with perfect recall. The character's face is the **ABSOLUTE VISUAL ANCHOR**. Only alter features if the scene explicitly dictates a disguise or transformation that modifies these specific elements.
- **[CRITICAL - CONSISTENCY]:** Character attire, accessories, and general appearance MUST also match the provided canon descriptions EXACTLY, unless the scene explicitly calls for a change.
- **[CRITICAL - TRANSGENDER REPRESENTATION]:** If a character is described as transgender, ensure their portrayal is consistently feminine in features and presentation, respecting their identity as per the character canon, unless an explicit disguise is part of this specific scene's prompt.
- **[CRITICAL - TEXT EMBEDDING]:** If the scene context implies text within the image (speech bubbles, signs, captions), render it CLEARLY and LEGIBLY as a visual element.

**[NEGATIVE PROMPTS - ABSOLUTELY AVOID]**
- **NEVER DEVIATE FACIAL FEATURES:** Do not alter character's established facial structure, eye shape/color, nose, mouth, jawline, scars, moles, or hair color/style from the provided descriptions.
- **AVOID VISUAL INCONSISTENCY:** Do not introduce stylistic shifts, rendering errors, pixelation, or digital artifacts.
- **NO WRONG ANATOMY:** Avoid malformed limbs, incorrect number of fingers, or distorted perspectives.
- **CLEAN TEXT:** Ensure any text within the image is perfectly readable and accurate.
- **BACKGROUND INTEGRITY:** Do not use generic or mismatched backgrounds; ensure they fit the scene and era.
- **EMOTIONAL ACCURACY:** Character expressions and poses must match the described mood and actions.
- **NO ANachronisms:** Strictly adhere to the specified era for all elements.
