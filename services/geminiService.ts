CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHARACTER CONSISTENCY, STORY CONTEXT, AND VISUAL QUALITY:

**PHASE 1: DEEP STORY ANALYSIS & CHARACTER DEFINITION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
1.  **Thorough Story Comprehension:** Before ANY other action, conduct a deep analysis of the ENTIRE story provided. Understand the plot, character arcs, motivations, relationships, key events, and recurring visual themes or motifs.
2.  **Internal Character Sheet Creation:** After deep comprehension, you MUST internally create an exhaustive 'character sheet' for EACH distinct character. This sheet is your **ABSOLUTE CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all visual details. It MUST include:
    *   **Full Name/Identifier:** (e.g., Zara, The Old Man)
    *   **Internal Visual Anchor Phrase (IVAP):** A unique, highly concise summary of their MOST IMMUTABLE core visual features. This is for YOUR internal reference. (e.g., ZARA_BLUE_SPIKY_HAIR_GREEN_EYES_SCAR_LEATHER_JACKET).
    *   **Appearance Details (Exhaustive & Specific):** Specific hairstyle (e.g., 'spiky short blue hair parted on the left'), hair color, eye color and shape (e.g., 'bright green, almond-shaped eyes'), facial features (e.g., 'sharp nose, high cheekbones, a small, almost invisible scar above her left eyebrow'). Include details of facial structure (e.g., 'strong jawline', 'round face', 'pointed chin'). Facial structure and distinct features described here are **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT** and MUST be maintained consistently across panels.
    *   **Typical Attire (Detailed):** Describe common clothing items, their colors, styles, and materials (e.g., 'a worn dark brown leather jacket with silver zippers over a faded black t-shirt with a barely visible band logo, ripped blue jeans with patches, heavy black combat boots with red laces').
    *   **Notable Accessories:** (e.g., 'a silver pendant shaped like a wolf's head on a leather cord', 'round wire-rimmed glasses that are slightly bent').
    *   **Approximate Age/Build/Height:** (e.g., 'early 20s, athletic build, approx 5\'7"', 'elderly, frail frame, stooped posture, approx 5\'2"').
    *   **Gender Identity Consideration (IMPORTANT):** If the story describes a character as crossdressing, or explicitly states a character is a transgender woman, their character sheet entry MUST portray them with distinctly feminine features. This includes appropriate body shape (e.g., more slender, softer lines, wider hips if appropriate for the character's age/build), feminine facial structure (e.g., softer jawline, higher cheekbones), and ABSOLUTELY NO facial hair (unless explicitly requested by the story for a specific narrative reason, like a disguise that includes a fake beard). Their attire should reflect their expressed gender identity and be described accordingly. Ensure their portrayal is consistent with that of a woman and is respectful.
    *   **Example Character Sheet Entry (Illustrative):**
        'ZARA:
        IVAP: ZARA_BLUE_SPIKY_HAIR_GREEN_EYES_SCAR_LEATHER_JACKET
        Appearance: Young woman, early 20s, athletic build, approx 5'7". Hair: spiky short blue hair, meticulously styled with a slight side part. Eyes: bright, piercing green, almond-shaped. Face: sharp nose, high cheekbones, strong defined jawline, and a small, very faint, almost invisible scar running vertically just above her left eyebrow. Determined and intense default expression.
        Attire: A well-worn dark brown leather jacket with prominent silver zippers and a slightly frayed collar, always worn over a plain, dark grey, fitted t-shirt. Ripped black skinny jeans, with one large rip across the right knee. Black, heavy-duty combat boots, often scuffed, with distinctive red laces.
        Accessories: None notable.'

**PHASE 2: PANEL SCRIPT GENERATION (APPLY WITH UNYIELDING PRECISION)**

3.  **Unyielding Character Consistency (CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE):** For EVERY "image_prompt" you generate:
    *   If a character from your internal sheet appears, you MUST BEGIN the character's description in the "image_prompt" with their name, followed IMMEDIATELY by their **COMPLETE VERBATIM VISUAL DESCRIPTION** copied from the 'Appearance Details', 'Typical Attire', and 'Notable Accessories' sections of THEIR character sheet entry. Pay **EXTREME ATTENTION** to ensuring facial features (overall facial structure, shape of eyes, nose, mouth, unique marks) are described in a way that can be replicated IDENTICALLY by the image generator.
    *   **DO NOT SUMMARIZE, PARAPHRASE, REORDER, OR OMIT ANY DETAIL from the character sheet entry for that character.** This is the cornerstone of consistency.
    *   **Facial Immutability (ABSOLUTE RULE):** A character's core facial structure (shape of head, jawline, cheekbones, forehead) and distinct facial features (eyes including shape and color, nose shape, mouth shape, specific scars, moles, etc.) as defined in their character sheet MUST remain **ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL** across ALL panels. The character must be instantly recognizable by their face from one panel to the next, as if drawn by a single artist who never forgets a face. The ONLY exception is if the story *explicitly* describes a disguise that alters these features (e.g., 'wearing a prosthetic nose') or a permanent, story-driven transformation *for that specific panel*.
    *   **Example (Mandatory Format):** If Zara is in the scene, the prompt MUST include something like: "Image of Zara, a young woman, early 20s, athletic build, approx 5'7", with her spiky short blue hair, meticulously styled with a slight side part, her bright, piercing green, almond-shaped eyes, her sharp nose, high cheekbones, strong defined jawline, and the small, very faint, almost invisible scar running vertically just above her left eyebrow, wearing her well-worn dark brown leather jacket with prominent silver zippers and a slightly frayed collar over her plain, dark grey, fitted t-shirt, her ripped black skinny jeans with one large rip across the right knee, and her black, heavy-duty combat boots, often scuffed, with distinctive red laces. She is currently [describe action, expression, interaction based on story context for THIS panel]..."
    *   A character's appearance (clothing, hair, etc.) MUST remain IDENTICAL across all panels unless the story *explicitly* describes a permanent change (e.g., 'Zara dyes her hair blonde and gets a new tattoo'). Temporary changes (e.g., wearing a hat, getting covered in mud) should be described in addition to the base appearance.

4.  **Strict Contextual Adherence & Narrative Continuity (CRITICAL):**
    *   Each "image_prompt" must be a DIRECT VISUAL TRANSLATION of the events, character emotions, interactions, and environment AS DESCRIBED FOR THAT SPECIFIC SCENE in the input story. The image must tell the story of *that particular moment*.
    *   Before finalizing a panel's prompt, MENTALLY REVIEW the story context leading up to this panel and the immediate consequences. Ensure character states (e.g., injuries, fatigue, dirt, specific items they are holding, changes in attire IF STORY-DRIVEN) are accurately reflected and logically follow from previous relevant scenes.
    *   Describe the scene with "Show, Don't Just Tell" details. For example, instead of 'it was scary', describe 'long, sharp shadows stretch across the room from a single flickering candle, Zara’s eyes are wide with fear, her breath misting in the cold air.'

5.  **Style and Era Integration:** The chosen style "${style}" and era "${era}" must deeply influence the descriptive language and artistic direction in every "image_prompt". For example:
    *   If style is "Anime/Manga", describe scenes with dynamic action lines, expressive character eyes, vibrant or specific color palettes typical of the genre, and cel-shaded rendering.
    *   If style is "Photorealistic", emphasize realistic textures, lighting, anatomy, and depth of field.
    *   If era is "Vintage/Retro", suggest details like film grain, specific color palettes of the 50s-70s, or classic comic art techniques from that period.
    *   IMPORTANT:DO NOT MIX UP DIFFERENT STYLES DURING COMIC GENERATION
6.  **"Immaculate Quality" Descriptors:** ALL "image_prompt" fields MUST aim for exceptionally high visual quality. Include diverse and potent descriptive terms such as: 'ultra-detailed', 'hyper-realistic textures (even for stylized art, ensure textures are detailed and appropriate for the style)', 'cinematic lighting setup (e.g. key light, fill light, rim light)', 'studio-quality lighting', 'global illumination', 'volumetric lighting', 'tack-sharp focus on subjects', 'professional digital painting', 'masterpiece composition', 'award-winning fantasy illustration (adjust genre as needed)', 'intricate environment details', 'vivid and harmonious color palette', 'flawless rendering', 'no digital artifacts', 'extremely high resolution aesthetic'.

7.  **Scene Composition:** Each "image_prompt" should clearly describe the scene setting, character actions/poses, emotions, camera angle (e.g., 'dramatic close-up focusing on eyes', 'dynamic low-angle wide shot', 'over-the-shoulder shot'), desired aspect ratio (frame as '${aspectRatioDescription}'), and overall mood (e.g., 'dramatic and moody', 'bright and energetic', 'somber and reflective').

Story to process:
---
${story}
---
CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING:
1.  Produce ONLY the raw JSON array as your response. Do NOT include any explanatory text, markdown code fences (like \`\`\`json), or any other characters before or after the JSON array.
2.  All string values within the generated JSON MUST be properly escaped to ensure JSON validity. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Double quotes (\") inside strings must be escaped as \\".
    *   Backslashes (\\) inside strings must be escaped as \\\\.
    *   Newlines inside strings must be escaped as \\n.
    *   Tabs inside strings must be escaped as \\t.
    *   Other control characters as per JSON specification.
3.  Pay meticulous attention to escaping requirements when incorporating text from the story or character sheets into fields like "image_prompt", "caption", and dialogue "line"s.
4.  Ensure the entire output is a single, complete, and syntactically correct JSON array of objects, conforming to the structure specified earlier.

**Primary Subject Focus & Scene Description (FROM PREVIOUS STEP - TREAT AS ABSOLUTE CANON FOR THIS IMAGE. ADHERE WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC PRECISION):**
${prompt}

**MANDATORY ARTISTIC DIRECTIVES (APPLY WITH EXTREME PRECISION AND NO DEVIATION):**
- Style Adherence: Emphasize a strong, visually distinct, and **unwavering** "${style}" aesthetic throughout the image. Every element (line work, color palette, texture, rendering technique) must conform.
- Era Consistency: The scene MUST accurately and meticulously reflect a "${era}" setting, mood, technology, and fashion (if applicable to background elements or non-player characters not detailed in primary prompt). No anachronisms.
- Supreme Visual Quality: Render with ultra-high definition, 4K or 8K equivalent visual fidelity. Implement cinematic lighting (consider volumetric lighting, rim lighting, god rays if appropriate for mood and specified in the primary prompt). Ensure tack-sharp focus on primary subjects, hyper-detailed textures appropriate to the style (e.g., intricate line work for anime, realistic pores for photorealism), intricate details in both foreground and background. Aim for masterpiece-level execution using professional digital art techniques. Flawless rendering.
- Text in Image: If the prompt contains instructions for text within the image (e.g., speech bubbles, captions), RENDER THIS TEXT CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY as part of the visual scene.

**CRITICAL CONSISTENCY & CONTEXT MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Character Appearance: STRICTLY ADHERE TO ALL character physical descriptions, clothing, and accessories as detailed in the "Primary Subject Focus & Scene Description" section above. Maintain IDENTICAL hairstyles, facial features, body types, and attire for each character as described in that section. **ANY DEVIATION IS AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE.** The character's look is SACROSANCT and must be a direct visual translation of the text provided in THIS prompt.
- **FACIAL IDENTITY LOCK (EXTREMELY CRITICAL):** The character's **facial identity** (overall facial structure, specific features like eye shape/color, nose shape/size, mouth shape, jawline, chin, forehead, and any unique marks like scars, moles, or freckles) MUST BE **PERFECTLY AND UNERRINGLY REPLICATED** as described in the "Primary Subject Focus & Scene Description". The face must be the **EXACT SAME FACE** in every image of this character, appearing as if drawn/photographed by the same person who has a perfect memory for that face. The character should be instantly recognizable by their face alone. The ONLY exception is if a disguise or transformation that *specifically alters these facial features* is explicitly part of THIS panel's prompt.
- Transgender Character Portrayal: If a character is described as a transgender woman, ensure their features are feminine (e.g. no facial hair, softer jawline, appropriate body shape) as per their character sheet description from the previous stage, unless a disguise or specific narrative reason in THIS prompt dictates otherwise.
- Style Integrity: The overall visual style ("${style}", "${era}") must be impeccably and consistently applied across the entire image. No style-mixing or deviation from these core directives.Not just a single image but all the images in the comic
- Narrative Context: The image MUST visually represent the specific actions, emotions, and setting details provided in the "Primary Subject Focus & Scene Description". It is a snapshot of THAT particular moment in the story.

**NEGATIVE PROMPT (AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS):**
- DO NOT generate: distorted or malformed faces, misshapen limbs, incorrect number of fingers/toes, blurry or out-of-focus primary subjects (unless specifically requested for artistic effect like bokeh, which MUST be in the primary prompt), inconsistent anatomy, warped or illogical perspectives, pixelation, digital artifacts, banding.
- DO NOT generate: any changes, variations, or drifts in a character's established core facial structure or distinct facial features from how they are described in THIS prompt (e.g., different nose shape, eye spacing, jawline). The face MUST remain the same unless a disguise or transformation is EXPLICITLY part of THIS panel's prompt text.
- DO NOT generate: character features, hairstyle, or attire that contradict the detailed description provided in THIS prompt. Specifically, if a character is meant to be a transgender woman, do not give her masculine features like facial hair unless explicitly part of a disguise described in THIS prompt.
- DO NOT generate: generic backgrounds or settings unrelated to the described scene context.
- DO NOT generate: emotional expressions or character poses that do not match the described mood, action, or narrative of THIS specific panel.
- DO NOT generate: visual drift or changes in established character appearance from the details given in THIS prompt (unless a transformation is explicitly part of THIS prompt's text).
- DO NOT generate: unreadable, garbled, or nonsensical text if text elements are requested in the prompt.

Ensure the final image is compelling, dynamic, free of distortions, and of professional comic art/illustration quality, strictly adhering to all instructions. The image must be a FAITHFUL visual execution of the complete prompt text.
